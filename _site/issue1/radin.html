<p><strong>Grandmother</strong></p>

<p>The evening rustles a wind like a goat <br />
moving through underbrush I come from <br />
a long line of goats stubborn bodies bent <br />
in cold I promise I will return to Russia <br />
dragging a bag of bones build a courage <br />
out of the ones who made the road who <br />
danced like arrows in the leg of the fawn <br />
grandmother I saw you on the deathbed</p>

<p>arms the opposite of days fallen to pieces <br />
I stitched them into a kite flew the kite from <br />
the roof of the hospital cormorants alighted <br />
knitted you back together there on the roof <br />
we danced recalled the day we met fresh <br />
fallen from my mother I entered the world <br />
you were there clapping lightly your bony <br />
arms the small berets in your hair kulots</p>

<p>&amp; wind enfolding your bad leg swollen <br />
the size of goats huddling in the cold <br />
you huddled into the deluge of my life <br />
&amp; did I make room could there ever be <br />
enough room could I have called could <br />
I have written come over unannounced <br />
with buckets of lilacs potatoes buckets <br />
of deconstructed libraries arrows to</p>

<p>shoot into the walls for us to climb up <br />
through the ceiling the floors up into <br />
the matrimony of day to day the space <br />
between days into the rooms of what <br />
happens when we turn from ourselves <br />
long enough to see those gazing at us <br />
through windows of the self I saw you<br />
there turned away did not say hello</p>

<p>told my father to wait now you board <br />
the boat &amp; I am this stationary thing <br />
on the side of the river dark spilling <br />
out of my chest guiding you back <br />
to the banks where you wait for us <br />
already goat frozen on the sand<br />
starlight chewing through the body <br />
that housed the shivering world</p>

<p><strong>Why I Never Learned to Ride a Bike</strong></p>

<p>Imagine a new two-wheeler gleaming in the driveway. <br />
Imagine a boy staring at it, wishing he was excited.</p>

<p>Imagine him plucked from the ground by a tall &amp; beaming <br />
papa, placed atop this tangle of metal spaghetti, imagining</p>

<p>his femur pushing through his leg like a fractured birch <br />
through pinkish mud. Imagine him imagining his inevitable</p>

<p>death, head in pieces on the sidewalk, brain <br />
flopping like a fish. To imagine him imagining this</p>

<p>you must imagine his great-grandfather, Sam, wringing <br />
his hands in the corners of rooms as if choking</p>

<p>an invisible aggressor. You must imagine Sam remembering <br />
the Cossack on the horse, the saber’s arc, his friend’s seventeen-year-old</p>

<p>head cleaved off his seventeen-year-old body, spinning <br />
like a blood-soaked dreidel in the dirt. Once you have that you must</p>

<p>imagine Sam folded into his great-grandson’s <br />
blood, wringing his hands like a backward bell. &amp; in order</p>

<p>to imagine this, you must imagine back before imagining, before<br />
remembering, to when the Lord shaped the ones who would carry His body</p>

<p>on their backs like a bread that would never rise. You must <br />
imagine them crushed beneath the whips, gas, skulls</p>

<p>scattered like flower pots across the ambivalent snow,<br />
&amp; their voices, imagine, murmuring in the brain</p>

<p>of a boy, warning of the unseen force <br />
that hates him, aggressor waiting in the form</p>

<p>of small rocks, minivans pulling out of driveways, <br />
the world rushing past so quickly, too quickly, his heart</p>

<p>a pair of wringing hands <br />
that won’t hold on to anything.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Elegy for Grandma Bess</strong></p>

<p>Do you remember the story you told me when I was small <br />
&amp; frightened of sleep, the two of us huddled in the big blue bed? <br />
Story of a frightened wave that approached a boy on a beach <br />
&amp; said <i>Little boy, I am lost…</i> &amp; before you could finish, your voice<br />
like water unfurling over the sand, I slept. You did this. Tamed <br />
the mishegas barraging my brain, gathered me into the arms <br />
of your voice &amp; carried me back to my center.</p>

<p>Not all lullabies are sung. <br />
Let me speak one to you.</p>

<p>Look, I call you into this room. Look with your eyes, good again. <br />
Look at the rows &amp; rows, glimmering soft in celebration, the quaking<br />
shoulders, lashes ringed in steam.</p>

<p>Grandma, how shall I celebrate you? Let a new language be built for <br />
the occasion, built of your name. Let me drag your name from the bashful ocean <br />
of my lungs. Let me thunder your name in the streets, in the synagogue, let me<br />
teach the torah your name. Let your name be on the lips of travelers &amp; dogs,<br />
of presidents &amp; wild swans. Grandma, let me walk into a restaurant, sit down, <br />
&amp; when the waiter is clearly busy, four plates in his hands, let me say</p>

<p><i>Young man, let me tell you of my grandmother.</i> <br />
<i>Her name is Bess.</i></p>

<p>&amp; I’ll say the blue way your eyes blazed through those dark Chicago<br />
winters. &amp; the blue way that they waltzed across the country of a page.<br />
&amp; the blue way they considered the impassive shtetl mountains. &amp; their <br />
blue, blue glittering way as you argued the blue clear out of the sky <br />
&amp; their blue discerning way the day you drove me in the car &amp; <br />
told me the plot of the musical &amp; I fell in love with my future - the way <br />
you knew how to do these things - the frothing heart of your body <br />
wondering, learning, knowing, knowing, how you entered the world <br />
I imagine through the doors of some humming library, the words <br />
clinging to you, &amp; Chicago shook &amp; shook &amp; look</p>

<p>how Los Angeles shakes at your leaving. See us bent &amp; trembling - but what if <br />
I told you we were bent in joy? That the arrows of loss are not arrows, but trees <br />
blossoming out of our bodies, each of us, a forest - every tree, named Bess. <br />
Every flower, Bess. &amp; the moon making light fall down through the flowers <br />
is Bess, &amp; the whisper of the lake against the shore - Bess, Bess, &amp; when <br />
I told my friend about you she said <i>Your grandmother sounds like simply</i></p>

<p><i>the Bess</i>, o bless the bad jokes of a life we laugh at anyway! Funny lady, funny <br />
hero, let me say now what I did not say, what I should have said, let me open<br />
the phone book &amp; call every stranger, let me say to them <i>Hello, my name <br />
is Jeremy &amp; Bess was my grandma. She survived the Depression. She rocked <br />
the mighty kulots, wore an eye around her neck, a sapphire star <br />
that could see everything you needed even if you yourself could not<br />
&amp; all she wanted was to give these things, all she wanted was to <br />
survive at your side, &amp; look what she did, look what she made</i> <br />
&amp; would the stranger on the other end of the phone see me pointing <br />
at my father, my aunts &amp; uncle? Probably not. But that isn’t the point.</p>

<p>Grandma, let us move beyond the point, into the gibberish of praise.<br />
What if I told you there is no poem possible, only a blue flash of failure? <br />
Only a bewilderment grasping at sense - but no sense possible either! <br />
There is only before me the vaulting fact of you. Let us make sense another <br />
time - talking politics or books at the table - not when the heart is breaking <br />
like a sea against the rocks. O survivor, stubborn mother, maker of the funny-<br />
named potato, let us all say <i>Oy Gevault!</i> - the only language my heart speaks <br />
for you - your towering courage, your ferocious &amp; ferocious &amp; ferocious love,</p>

<p>did you know that when language failed you, you brought our hands to <br />
your lips &amp; kissed us invincible? That you stayed until your granddaughter <br />
arrived? Did you know it was peaceful &amp; you held her hand, &amp; yes, in that<br />
instant, all of our hands? What if I told you each heart in this room is a room <br />
in which you dance as though at a wedding, that you will come with us <br />
to the next room in which a feast is prepared, a feast for you, I mean <br />
what if I told you we we are going to eat after this, that we will all be <br />
fed in your home, could your eyes be any brighter, o, I hear them, <br />
I hear them dancing through this room, what if I could know anything <br />
other than how I will miss you. &amp; how the waves of grief  <br />
will call my name. &amp; how I will answer. &amp; how I will answer.</p>

<p>Grandma, what if I told you I know what happened<br />
the moment it happened - how you stood out on some <br />
unfathomable beach. How the ocean approached &amp; said</p>

<p><i>Bess, I am lost…</i></p>

<p>How you gathered the ocean into your arms<br />
&amp; carried the ocean back home.</p>
