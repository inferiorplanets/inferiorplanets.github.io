<p><strong>Another Jellyfish Poem II</strong></p>

<p>A purple jellyfish came close to drowning.</p>

<p>I pulled it from the ocean’s soggy hands—this time it only burned a little.</p>

<p>I was glad, actually, to know I was alive and real again.</p>

<p>Seemed the jellyfish had become tangled in its own tentacles, stinging and stung</p>

<p>in its confusion. And part of me thought this was deserved.</p>

<p>Then I saw how it shuttered under its pain—I decided to unpeel it. My fingers</p>

<p>throbbed, but its welts were worse than mine.</p>

<p>As it swam back into the tide, I waved, only to be hit by a paper airplane.</p>

<p>I unfolded it and found a message from my sister.</p>

<p>Why did you flee our old house filled with jellyfish?</p>

<p>Why leave the welts and scars behind?</p>

<p><strong>The Bear</strong></p>

<p>While our doors were closed and my sister sleeps, a bear has entered our house. A bear. Sniffing about down the hallway. I wake to it. I’m out of bed and it’s already happening. I can hear it moving quietly beside the dining room table. Pushing chairs aside, but not knocking them over. It’s trying not to make noise. But a bear does. Something heavy thuds behind the steady click of claws on tile. I’m opening my door just a crack. I’m looking down the hall. My sister’s door is open. And nothing else. Of course nothing else. Then I stop. Something in the dark. Large. A couch, slowly moving toward me. Two reflections. Looking straight at me. Now I’m already inside my sister’s room, locking her door. But what can locks do against a bear? It’s making its way down the hallway. Its steps are louder, heavier—the flooring thuds beneath my feet. I don’t know what happens next.</p>
