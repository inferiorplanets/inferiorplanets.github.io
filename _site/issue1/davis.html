<p><strong>backwoods dark</strong></p>

<p>on tuesday the Dog barked at the trap door &amp; she did not stop for 
three hours &amp; the guy who lives underneath us texted me to say that 
he knew that this building shouldn’t allow dogs and i did not text 
back because he is obnoxious.  then i opened the trap door and 
Climbed in with my flashlight.</p>

<p>it was backwoods dark in there.</p>

<p>my flashlight did not carry the distance i thought it should.  my dog 
stopped barking and walked in front of me.  we walked straight 
ahead for two hours until my Light caught a corner of a box &amp; then 
it caught a pillow &amp; then more pillows &amp; every inch of space that my 
light covered it Stayed in.</p>

<p>it had no where to travel to.</p>

<p>inside the box were Letters.  they all said “it’s hard for me to 
apologize but i would Become a Map for you.”</p>

<p>my dog and i laid down.  my dog and i forgave.  my dog and i slept.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>tell them other motherfuckers be quiet</strong></p>

<p>do you like my socks?  they’re from when i played</p>

<p>softball &amp; thought i was straight but you can</p>

<p>have them if you want them baby</p>

<p>you can have whatever you like.  you can have my</p>

<p>lips too i will leave them on your shoulder</p>

<p>where they won’t tickle you but they might</p>

<p>make you moan at inappropriate times.</p>

<p>that’s what i would want.  don’t worry about</p>

<p>overwatering the cactus i gave you it’s kinda like me</p>

<p>a little needy &amp; it thrives on attention.</p>

<p>i can’t be overheld.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>they have never felt this way</strong></p>

<p>we lit candles in our treehouse &amp; when the wind lifted it &amp; us out</p>

<p>of our tree it did not whip us around in the way i expected.</p>

<p>the candles floated as if they were in zero gravity but i’m not sure</p>

<p>if a flame would catch in zero gravity so maybe it wasn’t like</p>

<p>anything other than what it was.</p>

<p>we fucked in the treehouse &amp; i’m not sure if that put us in the</p>

<p>mile high club because the tornado did not announce the altitude</p>

<p>as we reached it.</p>

<p>that’s not a metaphor for anything though we flew in the sky like</p>

<p>paper &amp; the tornado let us down fourty-five minutes later all in</p>

<p>one piece &amp; shaking from each other &amp; featherless chickens</p>

<p>pecked the ground around us.</p>
