<p><strong>Flame</strong></p>

<p>It’s Halloween and I wanted to do something spirtually important<br />
but I’m too horny to concentrate on anything other than the gold<br />
in my mouth, all the possibilities that open up when I lay <br />
my head back and arch my throat to the sky. <br />
I feel moon beams vibrate against my skin<br />
and wonder which animal is growing inside me tonight. <br />
If I sound like I’m out of it that’s because I am<br />
and it feels fucking great, to light a candle and eat the fire<br />
without having to explain if it’s a metaphor or not, to be a person <br />
without feeling bad about it. I was going to meditate<br />
and kiss all the dead parts of you still floating around like<br />
debris in my rib cage, but I am so tired of being the housewife<br />
to my own body. All my furniture is covered in bone dust<br />
so now I don’t have anywhere to relax. I buy crystals and <br />
stuff clouds between my legs. I eat candy for dinner, consider<br />
fucking my ex, but as soon as I think about touching someone I fall<br />
from this cloud like a bag of dirt back into my body,<br />
like a prisoner of linear thought I am stuck in everyone’s<br />
idea of what it means to feel pleasure from the inside out. <br />
I scream at such high frequencies that no one can hear me. <br />
If you think this poem is about 21st century sex then you <br />
are part of my problem. If you are thinking about my clit<br />
I am telling you it doesn’t exist. You can see what I mean<br />
with your eyes open or closed, it doesn’t matter, there is nothing<br />
to see if you aren’t bleeding into yourself, flicking your tongue<br />
like a flame against the dark that keeps you.</p>
