  <h2>Zooey Ghostly</h2>
  <br><br>
  <p><strong>we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake</strong></p>

<p>we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / we took turns gasping through eachother’s hair / you me &amp; the wind / we shared wet palms in a whimper / the light bruised itself against the scene / &amp; discolored the bodies in orbit / we heard gunshots past the treeline / we watched the starlings whip themselves across/</p>

<p>please leave us here a bit longer /</p>

<p>please let us go together / we said to the empty sky.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / our bodies had laid there all summer.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / we laid on a woven blanket that we’d found in the trunk of your mother’s car / you told me about the horses of your childhood / i apologized for how sad birthdays made me / we tried to name the trees / as if they were a box of abandoned animals / that one’s called <i>drupelet</i> / that one <i>tumor</i> / that one <i>grovel</i> / that one <i>greif</i> /</p>

<p>&amp; then it was time to name the lake / but we’d used up all the names on the forest /so instead we named it after each other / so that when i said <i>julia</i> / or you said <i>zachary</i> / we’d have to see that we meant the other / &amp; not the swollen body of water beside us.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / the leaves were the color of an animal’s blood / &amp; the ground was the colors of an animal’s muscle/ &amp; an animal’s fat / &amp; an animal’s bone /</p>

<p>we were both soft enough to penetrate with two fingers / we were both soft enough to be torn apart / by teeth or by wind or by memory /</p>

<p>i trusted you / because my body was no stronger than a stonefruit / &amp; there were so many heavy rocks along the shore.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / we hid our faces from the canine wind / we’d almost made it around the sun / we’d filled our pockets with berries &amp; kindling /</p>

<p>i forget when the fire had started / 
or when it had reached the trees that we’d named.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>we laid together by the lake / the sky was empty /
we laid alone by the lake / the sky was empty /</p>

<p>the trees hushed the water / 
&amp; the water hushed our breath /</p>

<p>our bodies were still on the shore /</p>

<p>our bodies were still on the shore.</p>

<p><strong>Love Poem</strong></p>

<p>you’re snoring
&amp; the big dumb moon
fell over itself &amp; into our bed</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Love Poem</strong></p>

<p>let the panting moon press our faces down 
&amp; drown us in the bathtub night</p>
