  <br><br>
  <p><strong>WE’VE HAD A LOT OF FUN FOLKS, BUT THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT HELL</strong></p>

<p>I was born to be a Christian comedian<br />
Why do we drive on the parkway and park on the driveway? <br />
I love communion but I wish the Lord had picked coffee and donuts as his body and blood<br />
Do you ever praise God like a Jello salad? Get all wiggly jiggly for Jesus? <br />
These jokes set a fun tone for my fans <br />
These jokes fucking kill <br />
But there is always the shift<br /> 
I have to share what I’ve learned from my friend<br />
His name is Chad, he is in my small group, and he is a manager at the Enterprise Rent-A-Car off I-90<br />
Chad knows all about the occult because he bought a book <br />
The book is titled Everything Satan Doesn’t Want You to Know about the Occult <br />
I find the most vulnerable person in the audience <br />
Satanists use Christian blood to become stronger wizards <br />
Satanists cut off the genitals of children because they are sex maniacs<br />
I am in love with the dental assistant in the seventh pew <br />
Satanists don’t care about how much fun you had at the summer fellowship barbeque<br />
First Nebraska Agape Worship Hall has stopped laughing for over 5 minutes <br />
I picked the right day to try a new deodorant because it is super-hot in here<br />
She is looking down at her feet or maybe at a hymnal or one of those tiny envelopes <br />
You know where else is hot? You know where else is laugh-free? You know where else is scared? <br />
I have been doing comedy for 2 years and this is my favorite part<br />
Everyone knows where but I say it anyway<br />
Hell is <br />
A different woman that I am not looking at starts to cry <br />
A different woman that I am not looking at muffles a cough <br />
Some kid gets up to use the bathroom<br />
Satan is real, brothers and sisters <br />
That fucking kid is missing this<br />
Satan doesn’t take a break when you’re busy laughing at my extremely popular comedy <br />
Right now, out there, he’s poaching the lost and cutting off their genitals<br />
Right now he’s drinking the blood of your co-workers, your friends, and Catholics <br />
So what are you gonna do about it<br />
She looks up and I smile <br />
There is a bead of sweat dripping off the end of my moustache<br />
There is a string attached from my heart to her temple <br />
I swoon and praise the Lord<br />
I swoon and raise my hands<br />
Glory Glory, praise unto him, amen<br />
Omaha is mine tonight</p>

<p><strong>DREAM POEM – 6,301 VIEWS</strong></p>

<p>I have to talk about an extremely strange lucid dream I just had<br />
It is about 6:30 in the morning and I just woke up<br />
It was incredibly scary <br />
It was a nightmare</p>

<p>I was at a nightclub<br />
I didn’t have any money on me</p>

<p>but then I had money on me<br />
A kid looked weird<br />
I said something is about to happen</p>

<p>all of a sudden there was a gunshot<br />
I ran outside<br />
I was outside or whatever<br />
There was concrete or whatever<br />
There were about a dozen cops or whatever</p>

<p>We were all walking around <br />
All of a sudden I realized I had seen this all before<br />
I went up to a lady woman cop</p>

<p>She was just standing there<br />
I said <i>you are never going to believe this but I have to tell you something</i><br />
She called for backup <br />
and I knew that I was in a dream</p>

<p>I knew that she was a real demon<br />
a third person showed up <br />
I didn’t see him <br />
all of a sudden my head was in a vice<br />
all of a sudden I felt pressure <br />
right here<br />
on my head</p>

<p>I thought, <i>this is unusual</i><br />
whale noises started to happen <br />
Sigourney Weaver shit</p>

<p>The guy looked like a Goth or a butler<br />
and then I woke up</p>

<p>I hope you can see why this was definitely worth putting on YouTube</p>

<p>I haven’t made a video in a while<br />
but I wanted to share a story with you</p>

<p>Last night I had my first lucid dream<br />
and it happened to be a nightmare</p>

<p>It was totally weird<br />
pretty much what the dream was</p>

<p>was I was sleeping in bed<br />
I woke up and tried to walk out the door</p>

<p>I couldn’t control my legs<br />
my mind was distorted</p>

<p>You aren’t going to believe this<br />
but all of a sudden this guy came in</p>

<p>and he is someone in my real life<br />
so I am not going to say his name</p>

<p>but he pretty much trapped me <br />
and was trying to do stuff to me</p>

<p>but then I realized I was dreaming <br />
and then I knew I was in control</p>

<p>I looked down at my hands and made them turn into eagle heads<br />
haha!</p>

<p>I pretty much don’t remember anything else<br /></p>

<p>Oh by the way<br />
I wanted to let you guys know that I am going to be making way more videos this summer now that my school is out</p>

<p>I am going to be making some vegan recipe videos<br />
some fun things</p>

<p>and I also have a couple theories I want to share with you guys!<br /></p>

<p>Follow my twitter<br />
Peace out!</p>

<p><strong>DREAM POEM – 11,161 VIEWS</strong></p>

<p>Hey guys, what’s up?</p>

<p>Okay so months and months ago I made a video called <i>THE DANGERS OF ASTRAL PROJECTION</i></p>

<p>I only got one comment on the video</p>

<p>It said that the video should be deleted</p>

<p>That made me sad</p>

<p>In everything we do in everyday life we take risks in everything we do</p>

<p>Like when you are doing nothing wrong and a drunk driver takes your life</p>

<p>With Astral Projection, the only danger is your own mind</p>

<p>Some people are afraid that something will attach itself to their sleeping body</p>

<p>Go to places like graveyards or legit real haunted houses or places like museums</p>

<p>You realize that things attach to you all the time</p>

<p>Something attaching to your sleeping body is not a bad thing so don’t worry</p>

<p>Other people are like, what if my silver cord gets cut?</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, your silver cord is what connects your soul to your body</p>

<p>Trust me, there is a 99% chance that your silver cord will not get cut</p>

<p>I’ve only heard one case of this happening to someone, and they weren’t even a nice person</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that your silver cord will get cut</p>

<p>It’s true, if you piss off the wrong spirits they are not going to be very happy about it</p>

<p>If you are going to Astral Project, you have to study all types of beings</p>

<p>Demons are scary but if you are friendly with them they will appreciate you</p>

<p>Post comments if you have any fears you want to discuss</p>
