  <p>i.<br /><br />
a second life trembles<br />
in the<br />
      blindness between<br />
      my blinks.<br />
uneven teeth, microbeaded tongue, the<br />
texture of hopping oil on skin,<br />
      a memory of the sun loving us:<br />
            i am smearing a gradient<br />
            of saliva on your shoulder<br />
            + watching it<br />
      dry.<br />
you become a fragmented me and we tumble,<br />
helically, till we are dizzy and sated but nowhere<br />
closer to making sense of this chaos,<br />
            tho we try.<br /><br />
first, thru fingers:<br />
      a sensation. all my subatomic<br />
particles are close and vibrating closely<br />
            but never touching.<br />
&amp; i rub my hands in the wet but can<br />
never be a part of it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>you tell me this: <br />
            you keep having dreams about birds perching on your gravestone.<br />
            the birds are all different shapes and the soil is a fresh rectangle. the<br />
            dirt is upturned and soft-seeming, with some small three-pronged<br />
            feetprints. the birds are all calling out for their mates. some look<br />
            left, some right, while others stare dispassionately into the fogged<br />
            distance as though they are in a trance, performing this action only<br />
            because of biology or genetic memory or some sort of ancestral<br />
            trauma that they are otherwise detached from. none of the calls are<br />
            returned. still, they stay there, drenched in lonely birdsong. calling<br />
            out in desperation or out of obligation or because they have<br />
            forgotten how to do anything else. days pass, pressing over each<br />
            other like wet leaves. at this point, you realize that the birds are<br />
            slowly dying, frozen corpses still perched on your forever-home,<br />
            beaks parted on a syllable. you are horrified at first, but then<br />
            comforted by their bodies, scattered on top of yours. you make a<br />
            wish for each one and then wonder what the combination of your<br />
            decomposition will produce. this is when you wake up.<br /><br />
ii.<br /><br />
when i meditate or masturbate,<br />
i am often thinking of the fish tank<br />
at the local Chinese place<br />
      &amp; the bloated, unmoving bodies<br />
      of the fish, as figures of transcendence;<br />
            a gesture towards salvation or,<br />
            something less kinky like.<br /><br />
i start pressing leaves between<br />
books and you decide to<br />
      “LOOK AT MORE SUNSETS<br />
      AND NECKS OF PIGEONS”<br /><br />
as an exercise in being<br /><br />
&amp; we agree over canned<br />
beans and rice,<br />
      that life is moving<br />
      too fast to capture<br />
so we surrender to it &amp; break<br />
the cameras on our phones<br />
with our fists<br /><br />
iii.<br /><br />
when the aliens crash land amongst the cows, dizzy and a little<br />
hungover, they wake to milky sunshine and the smell of manure.<br />
they look at the cows and themselves and the grass and the cud<br />
clumped on the cows’ jaws and their eyes and their tails and the<br />
flies swatted by their tails and feel at peace. the only thing they<br />
see is pasture and sky. they know that there are other things<br />
beyond the horizon and that they could see them if they moved<br />
steadily in one direction or another—but a cow moos in the<br />
distance and the sound holds in it, both, the hollowness of the<br />
universe and a moment of clarity: they stay where they are and<br />
touch the earth and let the gnats sit on their skin. when the sun<br />
goes down and it starts to rain, they leave with the memory of<br />
grass on their bodies.<br /><br />
iv.<br /><br />
i become preoccupied with water &amp; how<br />
      preservation requires dehydration, maybe a<br />
      pinch of salt or some sort of chemical<br />
            solution that is unhealthy for the planet<br />
            &amp; our lungs.<br /></p>
