  <p><em>Sleeping drugs</em></p>

<p>I spend so much time âˆ™ praying to little men on other planets âˆ™ have you heard? âˆ™ there is intelligence in the sky âˆ™ Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot âˆ™ about space rocks âˆ™ the way you can crack them open âˆ™ and find life inside âˆ™ I am also made of glitter âˆ™ I look down at my knuckles and they glitter âˆ™ the way concrete glitters below streetlights âˆ™<br /><br />
I am so young âˆ™ I miss skinning my knees âˆ™ on concrete âˆ™ what if the moon âˆ™ is really just a small mound of cocaine âˆ™ a lot of things would make more sense âˆ™ for example âˆ™ when we were young âˆ™ we skinned our knees and became used to the feeling âˆ™ now we look for the feeling âˆ™ we stay awake looking âˆ™<br /><br />
we look to the sky âˆ™ we look to the sky for answers âˆ™ and settle for small pills in glass bottles âˆ™ we settle for ingestion âˆ™ but tell me âˆ™ would you ever say no âˆ™ to a small blue man âˆ™ from some tiny moon âˆ™ if he promised you answers? âˆ™ if you have ever tripped âˆ™ in the middle of a busy midnight street âˆ™ you know something about what that feels like âˆ™ lights flashing in thousands of places âˆ™ and nothing to hold on to âˆ™ this is why I like to think of aliens âˆ™ small gods of moving bodies</p>

<p><em>Variations on the ways his music feed is a love poem and I hate it</em></p>

<p>Sometimes itâ€™s too hard to live. Listening to his music feed<br />
is like watching him fall in love. It is too hard to talk about<br />
no matter how I describe it. Tearing away thin white shirts<br />
as if anything is secret anymore. Blue moon &amp; electric light.<br />
Our air is thin &amp; cold. Iâ€™m afraid of life. Everything is smoke<br />
&amp; ghosts. Iâ€™m afraid of soft things. Iâ€™m not used to observing<br />
from so far away. I want the moon to turn into a bright fox<br />
&amp; kill everything on earth. I want to strangle everything I see.<br />
I hate watching people fall in love &amp; I canâ€™t stop saying that<br />
because what Iâ€™m seeing is going to kill me. Do you see this?<br />
All purple meat &amp; thick heavy life. Iâ€™ve been in love with you<br />
so many times. Iâ€™m worried about smoke. Iâ€™m worried about<br />
so much dark blood. Iâ€™ve been coughing for so many nights<br />
&amp; my small fires donâ€™t make me any warmer. If I were better<br />
with metamorphosis, I wouldnâ€™t want to die every morning<br />
&amp; night. I am coughing, &amp; I think Iâ€™m going to live like this<br />
for a long time. The night is a cold pink fog with lots of sad<br />
animals. I cough into the big sky &amp; I want to cry all the time.<br />
I want love the same way I want hot wine &amp; a new raincoat.<br />
When you introduce me to the dark, I want to grow &amp; shift<br />
with it. I donâ€™t know how to look into the night &amp; see myself<br />
in it. This is so important. I want to kill myself over &amp; over<br />
&amp; wake up somewhere gorgeous.<br /></p>

<p><em>Itâ€™s November again</em></p>

<p>This time last year, I was so lonely. Sometimes, thatâ€™s just<br />
how it has to be. Sometimes, I just want to cover myself<br />
in tiny electric blankets &amp; cry forever. Itâ€™s November again<br />
&amp; Iâ€™m ready to cry. Each year, something different. Nothing<br />
will ever be like the night I went to get coffee across a park<br />
covered in late-October frost &amp; missed death by an inch<br />
or a centimeter. It makes no difference no matter how<br />
you count it. I am filled with hot coffee &amp; so much smoke<br />
that most of the time, itâ€™s hard to see clearly. It fills my eyes<br />
&amp; my whole heart. A piece of flesh the size of a some small<br />
animal. Some thoughts Iâ€™ve had recently: the brightest<br />
thing in the world. The moon on Halloween. The kind of meat<br />
we eat after everyone else has gone to sleep. Like everybody<br />
else, I want to die someday but not anytime soon. I like dusk<br />
just as much as anyone but I think Iâ€™m becoming more keen<br />
on sunlight, waking up to the sweet &amp; coffee of the kitchen<br />
&amp; all those birds. There are plastic spikes on my windowsill<br />
to keep the pigeons away &amp; I donâ€™t know what to think<br />
about that. Things like that fill my whole entire animal heart<br />
just like the smoke &amp; coffee. Thin heat from the radiator<br />
in the library. Frosty fields where I almost died &amp; died again<br />
until I forgot what it means to die or stay alive. Itâ€™s November<br />
again &amp; most of us are still alive. This makes me so glad except<br />
for the fact that it has to be said. I look outside &amp; a black flock<br />
of birds erupts into something thatâ€™s never been described before.<br /></p>

<p><em>Love poem without anything real</em></p>

<p>I can smell your bodyÂ Â Â Â Â Â in my body<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â &amp; the ocean is glittering like itâ€™s supposed to<br /><br />
I donâ€™t know anythingÂ Â Â Â Â Â about whatâ€™s supposed to be said<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Iâ€™m too loudÂ Â Â Â Â Â I canâ€™t breathe<br /><br />
I donâ€™t know what time it isÂ Â Â Â Â Â sweating<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â so many monsters<br /><br />
none of them are bloodyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Iâ€™m bloody<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â beneath my nailsÂ Â Â Â Â Â I feel it there<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â why is anythingÂ Â Â Â Â Â here<br /><br />
here is the black dog the beachÂ Â Â Â Â Â the bathroom<br />
<br />I donâ€™t understand anythingÂ Â Â Â Â Â the black dog is real<br /><br />
I promiseÂ Â Â Â Â Â walking the boardwalk like itâ€™s supposed to<br /><br />
&amp; here we areÂ Â Â Â Â Â sleeping like weâ€™re supposed to<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â it is two oâ€™clock in the morning &amp; I am tired<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â I am so tired</p>

<p><em>Starbucks love story</em></p>

<p>I saw you across the room you were wearing<br />
salmon shorts and a blue polo I remember<br />
your order it was something unsweetened<br />
and iced with extra soy milk I thought Oh<br />
me too you walked over to me and I prayed<br />
everyone stopped moving and one lightbulb<br />
flickered the planet stopped mid-spin it hung<br />
in empty space it began to fall toward Pluto<br />
but before passing Jupiter you turned around<br />
everyone kept moving nothing had changed<br />
except now the sun was smaller in the sky<br />
and Jupiter floated on the horizon like a big<br />
orange I remember because I was sitting near<br />
the window so I could see down the street<br />
there were clouds but not enough to cover<br />
the peach-yellow sky all of the ice in my drink<br />
melted and so did my plastic cup the whole<br />
time I donâ€™t think you even saw me or maybe<br />
you were the girl with the neon shirt the thick<br />
black tattoos on your back the bleach-blonde<br />
hair and we didnâ€™t stop at Jupiter we fell all<br />
the way to Pluto and we kept falling until we all<br />
fell off this planet and onto Pluto donâ€™t you know<br />
thereâ€™s a Starbucks on Pluto and you turned<br />
around and stepped outside into the rocky<br />
beige I sighed and looked back down <em>Oh a text</em><br /></p>

<p><em>Wildfire</em></p>

<p>a room ðŸ”ª or an empty room ðŸ”ª a room with an evergreen ðŸ”ª a room with snow ðŸ”ª a room thatâ€™s all windows ðŸ”ª a room with no windows ðŸ”ª a room with no walls ðŸ”ª with no light ðŸ”ª no moon ðŸ”ª a room full of smoke ðŸ”ª a swallowed room ðŸ”ª a hollow room ðŸ”ª a room of dead things ðŸ”ª a pile of skins ðŸ”ª and next to it ðŸ”ª a pile of bones ðŸ”ª a pile of knives</p>
