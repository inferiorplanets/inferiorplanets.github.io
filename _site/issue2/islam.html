  <h1 class="post-title">4 Poems by Nazifa Islam</h1>
  <br><br>
  <p><em>Early Spring</em></p>

<p>I was standing in front of my sister’s headstone when<br />
a boy of ash and snow found me.<br /><br /></p>

<p>He sat down on damp grass and said <i>I come to all the children’s<br />
graves. Come sit.</i> So I did.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I looked around at rows of markers—white and yellow roses<br />
resting against stone after stone—wondered<br /><br /></p>

<p>how many children were asleep here.<br />
I studied the boy’s thin face<br /><br /></p>

<p>his small body of speckled grey snow. He looked tired.<br />
He may have wept moments ago.<br /><br /></p>

<p>He gently lay my carnations<br />
against her white stone, plucking one to hold<br /><br /></p>

<p>in his slender fingers. He considered the flush of soft pink:<br />
<em>I like it best when there are no thorns.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><em>Caesura</em></p>

<p>They have been seeking her so many years that once they find her<br />
they won’t leave: they grasp at the window panes<br />
thud at the door. And when she won’t put her hand to the brass knob<br />
the hissing gossamer of their words creeps between cracks<br />
and binds itself to her. Their anger seeps into her skin, sets her nerves aflame.<br />
The ghosts of memory remind her that abandonment never heals.<br />
She falls to her knees under the pain of their grief and begs<br />
for mercy they refuse to grant her.<br />
The dirty windows are soon shuddering, the warped door splintering<br />
beneath insistent fists. But glass shatters first:<br />
ghosts peep inside and leer. They glide over jagged glass<br />
and demand she take them back. She shakes her head, cringes, backs away—<br />
they’re not chastened when she explains she damned them<br />
to wandering the earth on feeble legs because they’d grown too bitter<br />
for her to stomach. That she cut them from her and fled<br />
in the dark because the pain was unbearable.<br />
These memories clasp at her twitching body. They sink into her.<br />
She grows cold under their clutching fingers.<br />
They vanish and bruises bloom. Her muscles refuse to hold her<br />
and she’s left lying on the floor, sodden with visions<br />
of who she’ll never be again, repeating over and over<br />
<em>Why does it hurt to be whole and human?</em><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><em>Delving the Hinterlands</em></p>

<p>I like pretending the world is in love with me<br />
and that the dust in the air belongs<br />
to pixies and today’s sky—its particular<br /><br /></p>

<p>shade of bewildering blue—deserves its own poem.<br />
I like watching the sun rise<br />
on mornings when it can’t quite bring itself to wake up<br /><br /></p>

<p>so pools of pink and yellow and orange—little<br />
shining rivulets—dab the grass<br />
for a long lovely hour before growing into one<br /><br /></p>

<p>seamless sea of light. I like listening to<br />
the ocean sing—that gentle thunder calling out<br />
to every sailor because it’s lonely<br /><br /></p>

<p>because mermaids aren’t warm-blooded<br />
and even salt water can feel too cold.<br />
I like ghosts who don’t have the heart to howl<br /><br /></p>

<p>who crowd the rafters and are always<br />
mumbling softly to themselves the names of living<br />
beings. I like dreaming<br /><br /></p>

<p>that memories can fade—grow opaque<br />
then diaphanous before weighing so little they’ll drift<br />
away on the most delicate curls of air.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I like lying in tall grass on blistering summer evenings<br />
inhaling the dewy scent of roses<br />
and wiling away the hours listening for the last<br /><br /></p>

<p>echoes of a bird song I know<br />
from my kindest dreams. I like believing in fairytales.<br />
I like staring up at the night sky<br /><br /></p>

<p>and trying to coax wishes out of stars<br />
out of those glimmering genies—those beacons<br />
of flickering hope.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Even the Embers are Dead</em></p>

<p>Standing in front of their fireplace, she threatens<br />
to set herself on fire. Sunlight glares through drawn curtains<br /><br /></p>

<p>tints the room bloody.<br />
He sits in a chair and looks past her into soot.<br /><br /></p>

<p>He is marveling at many nights spent whispering I’m crazy for you<br />
when now he doubts there’s anything left in her to cherish.<br /><br /></p>

<p>She is weeping, a ragged gasping. He considers<br />
their decade-old love; how they met<br /><br /></p>

<p>at 19 and 21.<br />
He knows that smitten boy<br /><br /></p>

<p>couldn’t have imagined ever saying I don’t want you anymore.<br />
He stares at what she’s become, knows all he wants<br /><br /></p>

<p>is to walk away. She throws herself<br />
against a wall and he does.<br /><br /></p>
