  <p><em>in which orpheus and eurydice steal a couple bottles</em></p>

<p>(i)<br /><br />
a half quart of rum later<br />
and orpheus is flat on the floor<br />
head in her lap, all grin and spin<br />
of world around him<br /><br />
eurydice (who is the world)<br />
strokes the little mollusc<br />
of his ear<br />
traces the outline of his mouth<br />
slides a finger in between his lips<br />
and curls to stroke the palate<br /><br />
she thinks: how strange it is to be<br />
a body<br /><br />
how strange and full of holes<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
orpheus still grins and so<br />
she presses fingers further<br /><br />
eyes the pulse now drumming<br />
in the throat<br /><br />
wonders if there might be<br />
a way to push herself inside<br />
and swiftly be the boy<br /><br />
till boy eyes flare<br />
as she presses<br />
just an inch too far<br />
and chokes him<br />
(just enough)<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
she holds her fingers up against his gaze<br />
and watches him<br /><br />
thinks of how a thought<br />
(like life)<br />
comes swift<br />
as swallows flying<br />
through a window<br /><br />
(‘have you ever wished<br />
that you were something other<br />
than a boy?’<br /><br />
‘do you mean, like, a girl?’<br /><br />
‘i guess, or maybe like a bird’)<br /><br />
thinks how words are wind<br />
come whistling<br />
through<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><em>oh weep and weep for orpheus (and eurydice is dead)</em>
(i)<br /><br />
orpheus says to eurydice :<br /><br />
when you were in the world<br />
i should have known better<br /><br />
should have known about the empty space<br />
where / the problem / always is<br /><br />
that a body cannot fill another body<br />
that a lack is only ever lack<br /><br />
should have known that joy is taxed<br />
and (like a little fist of pills)<br /><br />
is measured out<br />
and swallowed<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
it goes like this :<br /><br />
it is 3 AM and orpheus<br />
(afraid to go<br />
where she has gone)<br />
is grateful<br />
for the ipecac<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
orpheus says to eurydice:<br /><br />
(my love)<br /><br />
you are gone<br />
and i wake underwater<br /><br />
spread against the sand<br />
and drifting silt<br /><br />
spine broke and rib cage<br />
listing pieces on the floor<br /><br />
(my love)<br /><br />
there is nothing more<br />
to me than language<br /><br />
rotten as monoxide<br />
boiling in the blood <br /><br />
as a body rising to the light<br />
popping as it goes<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
eurydice says:<br /><br />
dear boy (my love)<br />
in dreams i wish<br /><br />
we were a field<br />
and horses<br /><br />
that we had stitched<br />
the earth with thunder<br /><br />
that we might have moved<br />
beneath the blue<br /><br />
dear boy (small noise
between my hands -<br /><br />
blue eye of my wounded love)<br />
i think about what happened<br /><br />
to the sky and drift<br />
the memory of you<br /><br />
to water<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><em>orpheus makes camp at styx while eurydice (a ghost / a ghost) watches him and says:</em></p>

<p>(i)<br /><br />
come morning and the crows<br />
arrive like omens<br /><br />
you wake to the sky<br />
and drift to being<br /><br />
light reaches in then through<br />
the gaps of you as shadow<br /><br />
the bronze of you<br />
unfolds a little space<br /><br />
between the world<br />
and what it’s not<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
how strange to think<br />
that myth will overtake us<br /><br />
that your name will be<br />
the name for grief<br /><br />
and for little children<br />
lost<br /><br />
you, small sound<br />
i sleep inside of<br /><br />
little song<br />
i hold against my tongue<br /><br />
little ghost<br />
returning home<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
these things i wished<br />
for you (my love) -<br /><br />
blue sky to stand inside of<br />
some kids to see it through<br /><br />
a field / a field / a field / a field<br />
a breeze to take your ash <br /><br /></p>
