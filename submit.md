Hi there! Thanks for checking us out! 

You can submit to our first issue by [emailing us](mailto:inferiorplanetsjournal@gmail.com).

We're looking for poems (3-5), prose (up to 1,000 words), and any art you've originally created (videos, music, jpegs and pngs). Please include the type of art you're submitting in the subject line of the email, as well as your bio and work (.doc, .txt, .docx, or .pages) in your submission. 

There's no theme, but if you'd like to send over something cosmic, we wouldn't oppose.

Submissions are open January 1st - January 31st. 


You are star stuff.


<3, 

Inferior Planets
