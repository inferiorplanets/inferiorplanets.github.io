**Sometimes a metaphor is worth dying for**

i  woke up to prove<br>
my love today<br>

sometimes I pull my shirt over my head <br>
and run around the apartment <br>
like a strange heartsick dinosaur

sometimes I dont

i read a poem once <br>
that compared love<br>
to extinction

another <br>
compared it <br>
to space

its funny <br>
how the mind can feel so implosive <br>
and awesome <br>
all at once

like the heart <br>
can be a dead forest <br>
with tree lines, shrubs<br>
and 100 red balloons i blew for you

I am lost beneath the red balloons<br>
Buried and dead<br>
and  thats ok 

everybody dies sometime <br>
and to die blowing balloons <br>
now filled with my dead breath for you<br>
seems pretty poetic

take a balloon to see the mountains,<br>
and the ocean 

hide it beneath your shirt <br>
and tuck your arms in like a dinosaur heartsick in valor

poke a hole in the side and smile <br>
like my breath was just released over <br>
everything i loved<br>
and I am now dead beneath 99 red balloons…
