**into empty glasses**

when the neighbor asks for us to quiet down <br>
a phone in my face lights up and you remind me  <br>
the show we watched that night no longer exists 

these dropped stitches in conversation  <br>
question if i’m the loudest in the room and feel ok  <br>
soliciting shiny cores of heartbreak to someone else

it isn’t enticing a bedspread a pocket quilted  <br>
like staying up without moonlight or street lamps  <br>
it’s my words hurting even overflowing cups

___

**one long life**

car ride chances to reflect  <br>
prepare my face  <br>
pressed into aged pillows

after afternoons <br>
spread sheets blow away  <br>
i spread out between 

the presence of people  <br>
and reasoning  <br>
with their calm

tying me to the bed <br>
i decompress into them <br>
every evening we elope
