**FLASHBACK II** 

<p>/ we will say it was dangerous but there wasn’t enough / before the doorframe/ before I quoted casablanca / &amp; meant it &amp; we wanted secrets / if you ask / i will put my awesome hands on your awesome shoulders  / &amp; yes in the doorway that is your neck // listen: this is all talk / &amp; you know affection is a stubborn thing / there are other ways to say / i want to know your body / &amp; yes / i want to press you against those elevator walls / put my mouth on yours / what our hands would do  / because what our bodies want / &amp; what they do get blurry in doorways / under streetlamps / after a couple good beers // there is something new here so we say / but we cling to what is comfortable / &amp; this is not special / let’s remember that when it’s time to get nostalgic // let me say / love is the hardest burden to maintain / but i only wrote it / because  / there is a romance in the way it sounds / we have two minutes before the next train / there are so many stupid things to say /</p>
