**WE CAN HAVE A SECTIONAL WITH A CHAISE**

<br> Here we are watching the amaryllis change colors in the living room. Here <br>
we are learning to kiss  on a dirty wooden floor. Yours was the ninth <br>
tongue to enter my mouth but the first to ever taste like a tongue should: <br>
not metallic or milky, just like mine, only yours. We are equal parts <br>
young & already dead, perfect & all wrong, quartz & aquamarine: <br>
we reflect ourselves & everything else & the sky. Here we are weaving<br> 
each other’s scents into blankets, printing each other’s body parts onto <br>
novelty t-shirts. I want to tell you: <i>We can have a bigger garden</i>. I want<br>
to tell you: <i>We can have dogs & babies & a silver staircase or we can not. <br>
Either way. It’s up to you</i>. I want to tell you: <i>We can make the staircase <br>
gold if you want, or platinum. We can make it out of moonstone <br>
even.</i> Here you are watching me dry off with your binoculars, or plucking <br>
a stray hair from my shoulder.
