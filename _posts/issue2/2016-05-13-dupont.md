April and I stared at ourselves in the mirror again<br>
April said *What the hell happened to you?*<br><br>

All I could do was shake my head<br>
It’s enough to sit alone<br>
In the shame of losing yourself<br>
But to acknowledge it out loud<br>
Was to sow my heart on my eyelids<br>
My heart on my tongue<br>
My nose<br><br>

I said to her<br>
I said to April<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April, here’s my heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here’s my heart Here’s my heart Here’s my heart<br><br>

She spread her eyes wide between her fingers<br>
And said *Here’s mine Here’s mine Here’s mine Here’s mine*
