*Sleeping drugs*

<div>I spend so much time âˆ™ praying to little men on other planets âˆ™ have you heard? âˆ™ there is intelligence in the sky âˆ™ Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot âˆ™ about space rocks âˆ™ the way you can crack them open âˆ™ and find life inside âˆ™ I am also made of glitter âˆ™ I look down at my knuckles and they glitter âˆ™ the way concrete glitters below streetlights âˆ™<br><br>
I am so young âˆ™ I miss skinning my knees âˆ™ on concrete âˆ™ what if the moon âˆ™ is really just a small mound of cocaine âˆ™ a lot of things would make more sense âˆ™ for example âˆ™ when we were young âˆ™ we skinned our knees and became used to the feeling âˆ™ now we look for the feeling âˆ™ we stay awake looking âˆ™<br><br>
we look to the sky âˆ™ we look to the sky for answers âˆ™ and settle for small pills in glass bottles âˆ™ we settle for ingestion âˆ™ but tell me âˆ™ would you ever say no âˆ™ to a small blue man âˆ™ from some tiny moon âˆ™ if he promised you answers? âˆ™ if you have ever tripped âˆ™ in the middle of a busy midnight street âˆ™ you know something about what that feels like âˆ™ lights flashing in thousands of places âˆ™ and nothing to hold on to âˆ™ this is why I like to think of aliens âˆ™ small gods of moving bodies</div>

*Variations on the ways his music feed is a love poem and I hate it*

Sometimes itâ€™s too hard to live. Listening to his music feed<br>
is like watching him fall in love. It is too hard to talk about<br>
no matter how I describe it. Tearing away thin white shirts<br>
as if anything is secret anymore. Blue moon & electric light.<br>
Our air is thin & cold. Iâ€™m afraid of life. Everything is smoke<br>
& ghosts. Iâ€™m afraid of soft things. Iâ€™m not used to observing<br>
from so far away. I want the moon to turn into a bright fox<br>
& kill everything on earth. I want to strangle everything I see.<br>
I hate watching people fall in love & I canâ€™t stop saying that<br>
because what Iâ€™m seeing is going to kill me. Do you see this?<br>
All purple meat & thick heavy life. Iâ€™ve been in love with you<br>
so many times. Iâ€™m worried about smoke. Iâ€™m worried about<br>
so much dark blood. Iâ€™ve been coughing for so many nights<br>
& my small fires donâ€™t make me any warmer. If I were better<br>
with metamorphosis, I wouldnâ€™t want to die every morning<br>
& night. I am coughing, & I think Iâ€™m going to live like this<br>
for a long time. The night is a cold pink fog with lots of sad<br>
animals. I cough into the big sky & I want to cry all the time.<br>
I want love the same way I want hot wine & a new raincoat.<br>
When you introduce me to the dark, I want to grow & shift<br>
with it. I donâ€™t know how to look into the night & see myself<br>
in it. This is so important. I want to kill myself over & over<br>
& wake up somewhere gorgeous.<br>

*It's November again*

This time last year, I was so lonely. Sometimes, thatâ€™s just<br>
how it has to be. Sometimes, I just want to cover myself<br>
in tiny electric blankets & cry forever. Itâ€™s November again<br>
& Iâ€™m ready to cry. Each year, something different. Nothing<br>
will ever be like the night I went to get coffee across a park<br>
covered in late-October frost & missed death by an inch<br>
or a centimeter. It makes no difference no matter how<br>
you count it. I am filled with hot coffee & so much smoke<br>
that most of the time, itâ€™s hard to see clearly. It fills my eyes<br>
& my whole heart. A piece of flesh the size of a some small<br>
animal. Some thoughts Iâ€™ve had recently: the brightest<br>
thing in the world. The moon on Halloween. The kind of meat<br>
we eat after everyone else has gone to sleep. Like everybody<br>
else, I want to die someday but not anytime soon. I like dusk<br>
just as much as anyone but I think Iâ€™m becoming more keen<br>
on sunlight, waking up to the sweet & coffee of the kitchen<br>
& all those birds. There are plastic spikes on my windowsill<br>
to keep the pigeons away & I donâ€™t know what to think<br>
about that. Things like that fill my whole entire animal heart<br>
just like the smoke & coffee. Thin heat from the radiator<br>
in the library. Frosty fields where I almost died & died again<br>
until I forgot what it means to die or stay alive. Itâ€™s November<br>
again & most of us are still alive. This makes me so glad except<br>
for the fact that it has to be said. I look outside & a black flock<br>
of birds erupts into something thatâ€™s never been described before.<br>

*Love poem without anything real*

I can smell your body&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& the ocean is glittering like itâ€™s supposed to<br><br>
I donâ€™t know anything&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about whatâ€™s supposed to be said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™m too loud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I canâ€™t breathe<br><br>
I donâ€™t know what time it is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sweating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so many monsters<br><br>
none of them are bloody&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™m bloody<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beneath my nails&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why is anything&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here<br><br>
here is the black dog the beach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bathroom<br>
<br>I donâ€™t understand anything&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the black dog is real<br><br>
I promise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walking the boardwalk like itâ€™s supposed to<br><br>
& here we are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleeping like weâ€™re supposed to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is two oâ€™clock in the morning & I am tired<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so tired

*Starbucks love story*

I saw you across the room you were wearing<br>
salmon shorts and a blue polo I remember<br>
your order it was something unsweetened<br>
and iced with extra soy milk I thought Oh<br>
me too you walked over to me and I prayed<br>
everyone stopped moving and one lightbulb<br>
flickered the planet stopped mid-spin it hung<br>
in empty space it began to fall toward Pluto<br>
but before passing Jupiter you turned around<br>
everyone kept moving nothing had changed<br>
except now the sun was smaller in the sky<br>
and Jupiter floated on the horizon like a big<br>
orange I remember because I was sitting near<br>
the window so I could see down the street<br>
there were clouds but not enough to cover<br>
the peach-yellow sky all of the ice in my drink<br>
melted and so did my plastic cup the whole<br>
time I donâ€™t think you even saw me or maybe<br>
you were the girl with the neon shirt the thick<br>
black tattoos on your back the bleach-blonde<br>
hair and we didnâ€™t stop at Jupiter we fell all<br>
the way to Pluto and we kept falling until we all<br>
fell off this planet and onto Pluto donâ€™t you know<br>
thereâ€™s a Starbucks on Pluto and you turned<br>
around and stepped outside into the rocky<br>
beige I sighed and looked back down *Oh a text*<br>
