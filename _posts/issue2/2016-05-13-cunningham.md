Me, new with the city cramps and he was all backwoods<br>
with false eyelashes took me to Nappanee<br>
fed me apples as his green eyes candled snazzy<br>
we telephone-wired long across country longly<br>
knocking round orchard houses, knocking round<br>
him with a hay-vein shining bove forehead<br>
he was my Swayfox, he was my Junkbabe<br>
on a furious trunk bottom where the apples mess<br>
where the napples just hill handpainted spotty<br>
we napped from time to time slurping radio<br>
off a highway tingle, two jabberdogs ripdrifting<br>
sleepwalking cross a screwgrass million<br>
came across a moss-eaten cop car corrupted all swamp<br>
all undulating green vines green as bile<br>
up with the worms the rain hoes us up warm<br>
where he holds me, narrating the field with our sleep<br>
and babble and presses me down gently until Iâ€™m<br>
pressing dandelions with my frame<br>
something plucks my wings wakes me up so<br>
animal in the way it, in the way it queers up moon<br>
as I love him beatingly with my elkhart<br>
with my nighttime gut of a brain<br>
