*A measure of f(l)ailing* 

My body as foreign object

As project of homeostasis

The seat of my soul

Sits in medicine cabinets

In vials and needles

This is phantom limb

Coursing from head to toe

This is defiant flesh

Irreducible to quantity

Or measurement

This is flayed skin

Resected

Resected

Resected

Till nerves are exposed

Till mind is exposed

Till the depth of exposure

Leaves ‘self’ open to air

Open to the whims of winds

Open to chance of corrosion

My body as open field 

I have not walked in

My name as foreign place

repeated in hopes of familiarity 

This is the struggle

towards comfort 

the mania of recognizing it 

as not-quite-right

This is that closest object

held in hand 

in crux of mind

This is all flesh and bone

corporeality

I am trying to understand<br><br>

*And they will call this progress, too*

You are rock <br>
are stone<br>
are placeholder of superlatives<br>
like<br>
this is what bravery looks like, <br>
what strength is made of, <br>
perseverance down to the bedrock <br>
you are stone <br>
atop hill <br>
plummeting down <br>
down<br>
towards <br>
possible dissolution<br>
toward fractures from fault lines<br>
from an inertia borne of <br>
external forces <br>
you are stone<br>
you are cold facade <br>
with indentations<br>
of another’s choosing<br> 
with markings from environment <br>
with erosion as your marker of time<br> 
you are stone <br>
and no words <br>
about the grace of your plummet <br>
can make it <br>
not so <br><br><br>

*I don't trust your sight*<br>

I want to kiss the corners<br>
Of your eyes   <br>
They are raw and angry<br>
Swollen from an exchange<br>
Of salinity or blows<br>
Coiffed collar  <br>
Lighting the room  <br>
Food has fueled a fire so bright  <br>
I delight in the heat of its periphery <br>
Tell me of the one you want to kiss <br> 
Who holds the space around you  <br>
So precisely  <br>
You can feel their release days away  <br>
These are distinct Like sea and storm  <br>
Taut and shattered pieces  <br>
A windowed scenery  <br>
and the be-speckled caulk to chide over   <br>
an essence flickering hungrily and its shadowy facade <br>
