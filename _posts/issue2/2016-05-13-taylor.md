1<br>
i would like to sink into this couch until i cannot feel my muscles<br>
convulsing & i would stop shaking & only be a pillow <br>
for people to kiss on.<br><br>

2<br>
you call me sobbing over a man that touched you when you were<br>
twelve & i told you i wish i could have protected you:<br>
i am always too late or not at all. <br><br>

3<br>
flowers bloomed today, babies were born, <br>
universes were possibly formed <br>
& my taxi driver offered me a cigarette in traffic. <br>
