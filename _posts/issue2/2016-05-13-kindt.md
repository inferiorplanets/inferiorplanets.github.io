*in which orpheus and eurydice steal a couple bottles*

(i)<br><br>
a half quart of rum later<br>
and orpheus is flat on the floor<br>
head in her lap, all grin and spin<br>
of world around him<br><br>
eurydice (who is the world)<br>
strokes the little mollusc<br>
of his ear<br>
traces the outline of his mouth<br>
slides a finger in between his lips<br>
and curls to stroke the palate<br><br>
she thinks: how strange it is to be<br>
a body<br><br>
how strange and full of holes<br><br>
(ii)<br><br>
orpheus still grins and so<br>
she presses fingers further<br><br>
eyes the pulse now drumming<br>
in the throat<br><br>
wonders if there might be<br>
a way to push herself inside<br>
and swiftly be the boy<br><br>
till boy eyes flare<br>
as she presses<br>
just an inch too far<br>
and chokes him<br>
(just enough)<br><br>
(iii)<br><br>
she holds her fingers up against his gaze<br>
and watches him<br><br>
thinks of how a thought<br>
(like life)<br>
comes swift<br>
as swallows flying<br>
through a window<br><br>
('have you ever wished<br>
that you were something other<br>
than a boy?'<br><br>
'do you mean, like, a girl?'<br><br>
'i guess, or maybe like a bird')<br><br>
thinks how words are wind<br>
come whistling<br>
through<br><br><br><br>

*oh weep and weep for orpheus (and eurydice is dead)*

(i)<br><br>
orpheus says to eurydice :<br><br>
when you were in the world<br>
i should have known better<br><br>
should have known about the empty space<br>
where / the problem / always is<br><br>
that a body cannot fill another body<br>
that a lack is only ever lack<br><br>
should have known that joy is taxed<br>
and (like a little fist of pills)<br><br>
is measured out<br>
and swallowed<br><br>
(ii)<br><br>
it goes like this :<br><br>
it is 3 AM and orpheus<br>
(afraid to go<br>
where she has gone)<br>
is grateful<br>
for the ipecac<br><br>
(iii)<br><br>
orpheus says to eurydice:<br><br>
(my love)<br><br>
you are gone<br>
and i wake underwater<br><br>
spread against the sand<br>
and drifting silt<br><br>
spine broke and rib cage<br>
listing pieces on the floor<br><br>
(my love)<br><br>
there is nothing more<br>
to me than language<br><br>
rotten as monoxide<br>
boiling in the blood <br><br>
as a body rising to the light<br>
popping as it goes<br><br>
(iv)<br><br>
eurydice says:<br><br>
dear boy (my love)<br>
in dreams i wish<br><br>
we were a field<br>
and horses<br><br>
that we had stitched<br>
the earth with thunder<br><br>
that we might have moved<br>
beneath the blue<br><br>
dear boy (small noise
between my hands -<br><br>
blue eye of my wounded love)<br>
i think about what happened<br><br>
to the sky and drift<br>
the memory of you<br><br>
to water<br><br><br><br>

*orpheus makes camp at styx while eurydice (a ghost / a ghost) watches him and says:*

(i)<br><br>
come morning and the crows<br>
arrive like omens<br><br>
you wake to the sky<br>
and drift to being<br><br>
light reaches in then through<br>
the gaps of you as shadow<br><br>
the bronze of you<br>
unfolds a little space<br><br>
between the world<br>
and what it's not<br><br>
(ii)<br><br>
how strange to think<br>
that myth will overtake us<br><br>
that your name will be<br>
the name for grief<br><br>
and for little children<br>
lost<br><br>
you, small sound<br>
i sleep inside of<br><br>
little song<br>
i hold against my tongue<br><br>
little ghost<br>
returning home<br><br>
(iii)<br><br>
these things i wished<br>
for you (my love) -<br><br>
blue sky to stand inside of<br>
some kids to see it through<br><br>
a field / a field / a field / a field<br>
a breeze to take your ash <br><br>
