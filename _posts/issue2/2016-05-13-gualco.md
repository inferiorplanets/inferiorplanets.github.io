Some mornings I wake before the trumpets start playing and it feels like a victory. Some days I wake in the wine cellar of the house I catered the previous night. These are the best mornings, when I am in a wine cellar and have beaten the trumpeters. If I listen closely on these mornings, I can hear them marching to the river, where the banks are diamond. I listen for their direction, so I can find the rivers they march along, but once they begin to play I am finished. Their music winds into my ears and through my body, licking my heart and I begin to shake on the floor, asking why God has hidden himself between the ceiling vent, why he will not just place himself on my bodyâ€”a chronic cut below my ear, a peculiarly-shaped birthmark, anything but these oversized ears and these ribs which are too narrow.
