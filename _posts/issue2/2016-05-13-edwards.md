Nobody likes showers as hot as me. I’ve learned this from old lovers. A new lover finds thorns where he wants his lips to go, so I buy a new loofah. Scour the past until I’m good meat. In the morning I am a body and at night I am a body. I’ve learned this from failed spells. I want him to press his palms upon my stomach and say, *My God, it’s full of stars!* I want him to know what to look for.
