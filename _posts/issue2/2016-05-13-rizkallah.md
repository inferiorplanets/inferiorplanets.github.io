*my other mouth*

i don’t know what sort of music my other mouth likes <br>
or what it knows how to whistle.<br>
im not sure we can harmonize.<br>
we don’t even talk.<br>
just meet by the moon sometimes.<br>
writhe because it tells me so <br>
without actually telling me so<br>
it just shows me: tangerines on fire. <br>
a burnt persimmon. the color of the scent <br>
of the sound of broken flesh.<br><br>

& my uterus a tongue. its breath all fever dream.<br>
my crossed legs a deadbolt. a clenched windchime.<br>
i am shedding three months worth of lining<br>
and the fine sand of what used to be glass teeth <br>
ripe from the angriest jaw.<br>
these bones fit for a nest of gum and fingernails. <br>
always snaps shut before the murder hatches.<br><br>

i’m never too torn up, even when i am,<br>
but i already know what i’d name all of them. every one.<br>
<br>
still, i grind my teeth down to nothing while i sleep <br>
i do this in more ways than one<br>
i swallow the wrong potions<br>
i thank the shadows on my wall<br>
right before i yell at them.<br>
<br>
don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, they say<br>
like this purge is always a gift. <br>
like this sea is all salt flowing out of a wound, <br>
and never just dead, never just wound.<br>
<br>
once, as a child, i woke up before anyone else in the house:<br>
looked out the window to find the yard covered in crows. <br>
every blade of grass. every tree branch. <br>
my mother’s car. no clouds. no sun. <br>
no witnesses. just black feathers.<br>
just beaks aimed at the sky. all of them still.<br>
then at once, all of them gone.<br>
a thousand crow salute bursting<br>
from my mouth if i let it.<br>
no not that mouth.<br>
the mouth i don’t like.<br>
the mouth i don’t want to believe.<br>
the only mouth anyone believes<br>
even when i don’t let it speak.<br>

*HOW TO SAVE TIME AND DIGNTY AND GET THE SAME RESULTS AS FALLING IN LOVE WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO FALL IN LOVE*<br><br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take a taxi to the sun<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give every individual hair on your body their name. every day, pull out one hair. repeat until you are completely hairless.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pour honey on yourself. say “i love you, honey” again and again while doing it. again. “i love you, honey.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honey is good. honey is nice. honey loves you and will always be there to make your body a cavity it fills itself with. this is not erosion.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don’t call it what it is. call it honeycomb. call it love.<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now bees. crawling all over your body. little kisses. don’t move. even when it tickles. you are part of something special here. even when it hurts. you are part of something special. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is what happens when we don’t call it what it is.<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now move. be devoured. consumed. etc. picked clean, bone dry, foaming mouth, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4a. lie down and scream.<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go to the ocean. keep screaming. scream into the ocean. with the ocean. never at the ocean, this part is important. never let it know you are there. it remembers everything & has no time for your shit, so eventually you need to stop screaming.<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when coming to shore & recovering from the layered sting your body has become, pass a group of kids playing football on the beach -- kindly request they punt it directly into your chest.<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go back to the ocean. always go back to the ocean. it still doesn’t care & it’s still screaming & it will never care & it will always be screaming, but you were starting to feel significant again. don’t do that.<br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always be screaming. always be pulling at hair. always be on fire but never carry any lighters. never inhale the smoke love blows through its ass, but always breathe. <br>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then stop. <br>
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then start, even when someone punts a football into your chest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remind yourself that you’re not actually the ocean. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you’re not a body of water, but you do have a body.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that doesn’t actually matter, but knowing you can churn and spit does.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
you will always be naming parts of yourself after other people <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& you won’t remember where you put them<br>

*one of these days here’s what i’ll do:*<br>

i’ll enjoy a cap’n jazz song<br>
maybe listen to it more than once and a half<br>
Ooh Do I Love You, it tells me, and one of these days<br>
I’ll love you a little less    <br>
<br>
i’ll sprout a brooklyn<br>
in my trachea &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;car honk alarms<br>
and bicycle tires where my legs<br>
“where my legs what?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they always ask me this<br>
why? just     where my legs, like<br>
where they are, that’s it<br>
that’s all<br>

one day i’ll hear certain names and not feel<br>
my organs drop into my butt to get away<br>
from my chest like when you<br>
swallow grand pianos to be<br>
all whale songs and less gut<br><br>

i’m trying to be a whale because of course i am<br>
the one that swallowed us once, stored us<br>
behind the steinway of its teeth<br>
let us choose the notes, let us play its jaw<br>
way past happy hour, we stayed for years and<br>
all the krill gone home<br><br>

i want to be home to more barnacles<br>
and less skin condition<br>
<br>
all so i don’t have to look at eyelashes sideways<br>
and notice their length like mine and identical<br>
skin around our ears like we shoved the same stories<br>
there lives ago<br>
when we were somewhere in the desert,<br>
how the heat fuses the flesh together<br>
to create one people leaking saltwater,<br>
or desperation, or some other form of love<br>
<br>
about the west flicking its loosies<br>
and us running to the rhythm of colonialism<br>
ashes ashes     fall down get up    and i’m still leaking<br>
and you take your coffee much thinner now<br>
<br>
the way that makes my insides hate me<br>
ruins the sonic plumbing, the pipes of me<br>
one of these days i’ll find us washed up:<br>
<br>
sidewalk on boylston st    keys smashed,<br>
right near the parking meter with the<br>
hippo sticker, faded url, an old mattress pad<br>
out of tune where my heart<br>
where my heart where? just where it is that’s it<br>
that’s all
