You can call it a dream <br>
if you want, if it makes you feel better <br>
to peel paint off the walls / gently lower <br>
pieces into your mouth /  Rainbow smile <br>
in the oil slick on the driveway / kids playing <br>
eviction / In summer these dollar bills <br>
melted on our chests, and peppered mango <br>
made our lips / bleed red / When you told me <br>
how this could feel / a Big Gulp cup full <br>
of bullets / your tongue wet / against <br>
the cigarette paper / I twisted in pleasure, <br>
until the whole of my chest turned, <br>
every possible color / It was always so hard <br>
to sleep in the city / I never knew <br>
what it meant  if I didn’t tremble, and you <br>
didn’t tremble / and neither of us trembled.<br>
