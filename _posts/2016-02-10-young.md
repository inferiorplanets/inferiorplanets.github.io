**wardrobe department**

justin bieber smokes a cigarette<br>
while wearing a cardigan, <br>
converse sneakers, and nothing else. <br>
he’s holding a pregnancy stick <br>
and looks distraught. <br>
soft grunge, the tiny screen says.

it’s five years from now <br>
and a song off of <br>
drake’s nothing was the same <br>
comes on and his ears take his body <br>
to the first time he heard it: <br>
you and him in the last seats <br>
of the L at midnight, <br>
facing backwards, headphones <br>
coming out of your phone, <br>
you with one bud, <br>
him with the other, <br>
and his hand on the bare skin <br>
of your knee <br>
through ripped black denim.

it’s fifteen years before then, <br>
summer, and she keeps hearing <br>
no doubt’s don’t speak on his car stereo. <br>
she is convinced it is a bad omen;<br>
the soft maroon cotton of the <br>
buick’s interior drooping down <br>
claustrophobic from the ceiling.<br>
her dad dies out of nowhere <br>
a couple months later. <br>
i know what you’re thinking.
