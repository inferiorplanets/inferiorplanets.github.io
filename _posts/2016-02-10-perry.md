**upon receiving a snake vertebra as a gift**
***for seren & katie***

a friend once gave me a line of poetry,<br>
love is a strong thing with a backbone,<br>
and she said: donâ€™t forget that you also<br>
are a strong thing with a backbone, &<br>
no one gave you that backbone but you.<br>

snakes are all backbone & skull.<br>
they shed their skin to grow & to heal from injury.<br>
i am a snake who holds on to all her old skins.<br>

love & i have wrestled, two strong things<br>
with backbones, & i have been wounded many times<br>
by love. i have been blessed many times by love.<br>
the wounds are the blessings.<br>
this is the lesson.<br>
