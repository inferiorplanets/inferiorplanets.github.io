**I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO EAT A MAN ALIVE**

but i do remember<br>
how it feels<br>
to love one quietly<br>
to bite your tongue<br>
in the background<br>
from far away<br>
hoping<br>
that your heartbeat<br>
isn't overheard<br>
by anybody

it's not unique just to me<br>
everyone out there<br>
knows what it's like<br>
to love something<br>
that terrifies them<br>
but i keep throwing myself to the water<br>
just to prove that i can swim<br>
i keep letting the current<br>
beat me<br>
from both sides<br>
for so long<br>
that it's no wonder<br>
i look like<br>
some kind of bridge<br>
to everyone

this year<br>
my life<br>
it even sounds<br>
like a mixtape<br>
about the river<br>
it even feels like a song<br>
that would sweep me up<br>
if i let it<br>
like a mouth<br>
that would spit me out<br>
and back<br>
into the ocean<br>
when it felt like<br>
it was done with me

the playlist<br>
this compilation<br>
let's call it<br>
<i>The River</i><br>
let's call it <i>Merrimack</i><br>
let's call it <i>Hudson</i><br>
call it <i>Connecticut<br>
Delaware / Potomac<br>
Patapsco / Raritan</i><br>
let's call it <i>James</i><br>
call it<br>
<i>Charles</i><br>
let's call it <i>My Feet Shivering<br>
In The Sacramento</i><br>
call it<br>
<i>Regretting You Beside Cherry Creek In Denver</i><br>
call it<br>
<i>No Matter How Far<br>
I Manage To Run<br>
The Mississippi<br>
Keeps Catching Me</i><br>

it's like that night<br>
when you asked me why<br>
am i so<br>
afraid of you<br>
that i finally realized<br>
you had no idea<br>
how much damage<br>
you could do

it's the sad<br>
willfully-forgotten truth<br>
that nearly all our rivers<br>
seem to be named after<br>
the people<br>
that we stole them from

nearly all my nightmares<br>
are for a hand<br>
that has barely touched me<br>
while i still carry the knuckles<br>
of so many others on my skin

they dub me
<i>Belle of the Bends</i>

they sing
<i>it's a long way down<br>
to the bottom of the river</i>

and i stare at the water<br>
between Illinois<br>
and Iowa<br>
for one last time<br>
this summer<br>
i watch these people<br>
casting their reels<br>
into the current<br>
and i see this boy<br>
this angry<br>
brooding<br>
little boy<br>
i see him catch a fish<br>
how he stares at it<br>
writhing in his hand<br>
and then<br>
how he throws it<br>
straight down<br>
at the sidewalk<br>
as hard as he can<br>
again<br>
and again<br>
and again<br>
and again<br>
and

**YOU TELL ME TRAFFIC**

is the sum<br>
of all our mistakes<br>
and as soon as i arrive in a new city<br>
i get it<br>
i am already so ready to leave it<br>
this Restless Everything Syndrome<br>
this<br>
I-Can-Smell-the Churches-From-Here feeling<br>
i would argue that Romero had it all wrong with his zombies<br>
there's plenty of room in Hell<br>
with all this holy apology<br>
it's Heaven that's getting crowded<br>
for the first time<br>
in a long time<br>
i'm not landing somewhere<br>
just because gravity won't stop asking me<br>
not because of some slowdown in the highway<br>
not gonna move to Reno because i Ran Out of Money<br>
every eye is automatically a tourist if it's open<br>
everything infinite<br>
but in small doses<br>
there's this story the rabbi once told me<br>
about how we travel through life collecting<br>
pieces of the universe<br>
all the happy and the hurt because<br>
it's the only job<br>
we were ever meant to have<br>
to help rebuild the infinite<br>
little by little<br>
in small<br>
doses<br>
and we both remember what it's like to sit in the pew<br>
alone<br>
all while everybody else eats themselves some Communion<br>
it's humiliating<br>
and strangely<br>
empowering<br>
how i was in each of my partners' sweet dreams last night<br>
how i told Elliot<br>
this is a good sign<br>
told them my spirit must be doing so well now<br>
that it can spend its time helping other<br>
and that y'all<br>
is a great example<br>
of wishful denial<br>
i confess now<br>
the reason i live inside of other people's dreams<br>
is because i'm just too terrified<br>
of my own<br>
yes<br>
i do want to die<br>
but i've got shit to tend to<br>
got too long of a list to stay here<br>
one day i'll be able to say<br>
i drove the circumference of the Earth<br>
for just myself<br>
for no one else<br>
every day is a day i almost never had<br>
gallows humor i know<br>
a wedding invitation<br>
God never loved anyone besides themself<br>
and that's the point<br>
i get it now<br>
i was just collecting another piece<br>
sure it's sharp in my hands<br>
but thank you<br>
really<br>
i mean it<br>
thank you<br>
eventually<br>
we all find some invisible thing to pray to<br>
so i will teach this demon to love me<br>
Layne tells me:<br>
the part where Lot's wife gets all pillar-of-salt<br>
is exactly why<br>
action heroes<br>
never look back at the explosions they make<br>
at some point<br>
everyone is their own preacher<br>
we both know to fear the Late Adopter<br>
the True Believer<br>
we have both been zealous and dangerous before<br>
so when the congregation says you are “hardening your heart”<br>
we know exactly<br>
what they really mean<br>
everyone's crawling along the Beltway still<br>
and we just decided to exit<br>

**SO I'M AT THE COWORKING SPACE INSIDE MY HEAD**

<p>trying to figure out how to write the rest of this book / when / i drop my pen / stare up at the eco-friendly lighting / at the communal kitchen / the kombucha tap / all the tech startup jackasses inside the coworking space inside my head milling about and telling each other how they feel about the protests on TV / when / at the desk across from me / Dr. Sanjay Gupta quietly puts down his dissertation on the Economics of the Liver / helps a man next to me decide if he needs braces / (he definitely need braces) / and then puts his hand on my shoulder / the whole world had just watched me totally choke live on Jeopardy the night before / but Dr. Gupta hasn’t seen it yet / might not ever / he doesn’t really care for Jeopardy / won't explain why / i tell him / i can’t do this anymore / and Dr. Sanjay Gupta folds his reading glasses and slides them into his breast pocket / he says / let’s take a walk in the Lavender Room / which apparently is a large / lavender-colored room / inside the coworking space / inside my head / i suppose people walk in a circle along the walls of the Lavender Room / in an effort to remember the things / they haven’t thought of yet / there is a point / when i ask the good doctor / if we get free printing here / he says yes / there’s complimentary root beer in the fridge / sometimes everyone gets together for game night / there’s a running contest up on the announcement board / of people trying to predict the exact year / the snow will finally melt / in Boston / Sanjay says / you can pretty much do anything you want / but don’t let them catch you sleeping here overnight / and i think / shit / that was my plan / i was going to wait until everyone left for the day / and get some actual rest on one of the fancy couches / wow / Dr. Sanjay Gupta is peering into me with those eyes / probably because i need braces / probably because / even in my dreams / even in the coworking space inside my broken head / even inside myself / i am homeless</p>

jamie mortara is an 8.5-centimeter aluminum sculpture figure stylized to depict an astronaut in a spacesuit. jamie was created by the artist Paul Van Hoeydonck, who was given the following set of design specifications: jamie was to be lightweight but sturdy, capable of withstanding the temperature extremes of the Moon, and not identifiably male or female, nor of any identifiable ethnic group. jamie was commissioned and secretly placed on the Moon by the crew of Apollo 15 at Hadley Rille on August 1, 1971. more about re-entry pressurization failure can be found at [jamiemortara.com](http://jamiemortara.com).
