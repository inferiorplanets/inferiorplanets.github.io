ANOTHER JELLYFISH POEM II

A purple jellyfish came close to drowning. 

I pulled it from the ocean’s soggy hands—this time it only burned a little. 

I was glad, actually, to know I was alive and real again. 

Seemed the jellyfish had become tangled in its own tentacles, stinging and stung 

in its confusion. And part of me thought this was deserved.

Then I saw how it shuttered under its pain—I decided to unpeel it. My fingers 

throbbed, but its welts were worse than mine.

As it swam back into the tide, I waved, only to be hit by a paper airplane. 

I unfolded it and found a message from my sister. 

Why did you flee our old house filled with jellyfish? 

Why leave the welts and scars behind?
