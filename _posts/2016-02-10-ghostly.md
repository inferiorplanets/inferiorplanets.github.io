**we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake**

we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / we took turns gasping through eachother's hair / you me & the wind / we shared wet palms in a whimper / the light bruised itself against the scene / & discolored the bodies in orbit / we heard gunshots past the treeline / we watched the starlings whip themselves across/

please leave us here a bit longer /

please let us go together / we said to the empty sky.

+

we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / our bodies had laid there all summer.

+

we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / we laid on a woven blanket that we’d found in the trunk of your mother’s car / you told me about the horses of your childhood / i apologized for how sad birthdays made me / we tried to name the trees / as if they were a box of abandoned animals / that one’s called <i>drupelet</i> / that one <i>tumor</i> / that one <i>grovel</i> / that one <i>greif</i> /

& then it was time to name the lake / but we’d used up all the names on the forest /so instead we named it after each other / so that when i said <i>julia</i> / or you said <i>zachary</i> / we’d have to see that we meant the other / & not the swollen body of water beside us.

+

we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / the leaves were the color of an animal’s blood / & the ground was the colors of an animal’s muscle/ & an animal’s fat / & an animal’s bone / 

we were both soft enough to penetrate with two fingers / we were both soft enough to be torn apart / by teeth or by wind or by memory / 

i trusted you / because my body was no stronger than a stonefruit / & there were so many heavy rocks along the shore.


+

we laid together by the lake / we laid alone by the lake / we hid our faces from the canine wind / we’d almost made it around the sun / we’d filled our pockets with berries & kindling / 

i forget when the fire had started / 
or when it had reached the trees that we’d named.

+

we laid together by the lake / the sky was empty /
we laid alone by the lake / the sky was empty /

the trees hushed the water / 
& the water hushed our breath / 

our bodies were still on the shore / 

our bodies were still on the shore.

**Love Poem**

you’re snoring
& the big dumb moon
fell over itself & into our bed

**Love Poem**

let the panting moon press our faces down 
& drown us in the bathtub night
