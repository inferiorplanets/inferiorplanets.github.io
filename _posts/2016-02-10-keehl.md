**winter waiting UFOS**

i’m reading about black holes to stop my panic attack <br>
you speak to me in linguistics i have yet to learn <br>
agastopia & a side of eggs sunless out the window <br>
my anxious dark matter makes 98% of my matter <br>
everything is matter <br>
so what really does <br>
i often find myself thinking parallel life<br>
some semblance of alright <br>
there’s always time for arbitrary reasoning <br>
yes space cadet yes static yes control <br>
you do not exist <br>
when you are not existing <br>
i text you that it’s good weather for alien abduction <br>
by which i mean i’m sad <br>
saturday is spent watching experiments<br>
this subatomic world <br>
you accuse me un-needing other people <br>
& i confess maybe i don’t need anyone<br>
maybe i’m just finding way to pass the time
