**from <i>The Beauty of Admission</i>**

In my dream death crawled out my mouth like a spider

I'm always spilling water when I try to make my tea

This is how I relax/Breathe in through the nose

Hold for seven seconds

Release for eight

**from <i>The Beauty of Admission</i>**

Anyone can predict the future although they're not necessarily accurate

I'll probably be alive tomorrow & that's good enough to get out of bed today

How many bees have died today?/Scratch that

How many hives?

Sometimes I still eat my boogers/I've read

they might be good for you
