___

since the turn, i have been making ready to move on

the ground & my teeth being brittle

when i sense i am coordinating i punch myself in the stupid face

& cannot master anything, even helplessness

if you read this poem out loud i will crumple like a galaxy

& ascend to your zone & you were somehow expecting

itâ€™s been a long year clawing at my throat

there was an inchworm on my kneecap escaping from somewhere

i learned that i am a neuron

have got to drink water & share with the plant

& light candles & kiss things

& keep trying to calculate the sum of my damage

there are no symbols

all things are simple until they are not
