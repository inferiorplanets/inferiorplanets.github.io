**WE CAN HAVE A SECTIONAL WITH A CHAISE**


Here we are watching the amaryllis change colors in the living room. Here 

we are learning to kiss  on a dirty wooden floor. Yours was the ninth 

tongue to enter my mouth but the first to ever taste like a tongue should: 
not metallic or milky, just like mine, only yours. We are equal parts 
young & already dead, perfect & all wrong, quartz & aquamarine: 
we reflect ourselves & everything else & the sky. Here we are weaving 
each other’s scents into blankets, printing each other’s body parts onto 
novelty t-shirts. I want to tell you: We can have a bigger garden. I want
to tell you: We can have dogs & babies & a silver staircase or we can not. 
Either way. It’s up to you. I want to tell you: We can make the staircase 
gold if you want, or platinum. We can make it out of moonstone 
even. Here you are watching me dry off with your binoculars, or plucking 
a stray hair from my shoulder.
