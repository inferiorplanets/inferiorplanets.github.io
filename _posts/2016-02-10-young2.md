**FLASHBACK II** 

<p>/ we will say it was dangerous but there wasn’t enough / before the 

doorframe/ before I quoted casablanca / & meant it & we wanted secrets / if 

you ask / i will put my awesome hands on your awesome shoulders  / & yes 

in the doorway that is your neck /

/ listen: this is all talk / & you know affection is a stubborn thing / there are 

other ways to say / i want to know your body / & yes / i want to press you 

against those elevator walls / put my mouth on yours / what our hands would 

do  / because what our bodies want / & what they do get blurry in doorways 

/ under streetlamps / after a couple good beers /

/ there is something new here so we say / but we cling to what is comfortable 

/ & this is not special / let’s remember that when it’s time to get nostalgic /

/ let me say / love is the hardest burden to maintain / but i only wrote it / 

because  / there is a romance in the way it sounds / we have two minutes before the 

next train / there are so many stupid things to say /</p>
