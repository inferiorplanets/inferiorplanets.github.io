**Bigfaced Moons**


Big Man sqeezes the cars down into pancakes,<br>
flattens them into the bitumen <br>
until their wheels are the tallest things.

Sleek disks slide down the streets,<br>
dropping tiny people off at the corners.<br>

The moon’s light reflects off their backs,<br>
bigfaced moons bouncing back and forth<br>
between earth and the outersphere.

Where does all the light come from, you ask, <br>
and Big Man crushes another car.<br>
That’s easy, he says, light comes from Big Man.

That’s not quite right,<br>
one of the tiny people says<br>
from down low on the concrete<br>
at the corner of Tory and Vivian.

Where do all the tiny people come from, you ask, <br>
but Big Man is on Taranaki by now and he can’t hear, <br>
big legs shaking the lightbulbs loose all the way up the hill.

A tiny person is holding onto your shoelace,<br>
his left ear sliding up your ankle bone with every step<br>
like a tiny caress.

Broken glass litters the footpath ahead of you<br>
and you’re happy the bigfaced moon is out tonight.<br>
Big Man rounds the corner and disappears.<br>
When is the next astronaut going up, you ask,<br>
at least tell me that.

A tan moth peeks out from the curtain<br>
when you pass the old dog’s house.<br>
You listen for Big Man’s response but all you hear<br>
is the laughter from seven tiny people gathered at the next corner.
