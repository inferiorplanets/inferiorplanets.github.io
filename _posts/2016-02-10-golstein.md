**WE CAN HAVE A SECTIONAL WITH A CHAISE**

<p>Here we are watching the amaryllis change colors in the living room. Here 
we are learning to kiss  on a dirty wooden floor. Yours was the ninth 
tongue to enter my mouth but the first to ever taste like a tongue should: 
not metallic or milky, just like mine, only yours. We are equal parts 
young &amp; already dead, perfect &amp; all wrong, quartz &amp; aquamarine: 
we reflect ourselves &amp; everything else &amp; the sky. Here we are weaving 
each other’s scents into blankets, printing each other’s body parts onto 
novelty t-shirts. I want to tell you: <i>We can have a bigger garden.</i> I want
to tell you: <i>We can have dogs &amp; babies &amp; a silver staircase or we can not. 
Either way. It’s up to you.</i> I want to tell you: <i>We can make the staircase 
gold if you want, or platinum. We can make it out of moonstone 
even.</i> Here you are watching me dry off with your binoculars, or plucking 
a stray hair from my shoulder.</p>
