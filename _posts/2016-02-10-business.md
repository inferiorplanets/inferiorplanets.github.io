**into empty glasses**

when the neighbor asks for us to quiet down 

a phone in my face lights up and you remind me 

the show we watched that night no longer exists 

these dropped stitches in conversation 

question if i’m the loudest in the room and feel ok 

soliciting shiny cores of heartbreak to someone else

it isn’t enticing a bedspread a pocket quilted 

like staying up without moonlight or street lamps 

it’s my words hurting even overflowing cups

___

**one long life**

car ride chances to reflect 

prepare my face 

pressed into aged pillows

after afternoons

spread sheets blow away 

i spread out between 

the presence of people 

and reasoning 

with their calm

tying me to the bed

i decompress into them

every evening we elope
