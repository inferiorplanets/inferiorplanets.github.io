Hi there!

Inferior Planets is a journal run by [Davis Land](http://davisland.info) and [Beyza Ozer](http://beyza-ozer.tumblr.com/) who both run some other things and generally just like to over-commit themselves. We like to publish good stuff each quarter. You should submit!

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inferiorplanetz) and like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Inferior-Planets-1702781196623263/?success=1) for updates.
